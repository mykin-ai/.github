## Hi! Welcome to Kin's GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

This is where we are building Kin, a personal AI for your private life.

We're currently building in private, but we have plans to open-source parts of the project to let the community contribute.

### ðŸ’¬ Community! ðŸ’¬

Our community mainly hangs out in [Discord](https://discord.gg/mykin), in there you can join channels dedicated to their respective projects, learn, brainstorm, provide feedback, be apart of our team standups, stay up to date on all things AI and SSI, as well as connect with fellow community members. 

* **Website**. Check [mykin.ai](https://mykin.ai) for a good introduction to Kin.
